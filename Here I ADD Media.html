    <h2>History</h2>
    This school started its journey on <i>22nd January</i> <i>1968</i> with
    <i>40</i> children in the grounds of Bangladesh Council of Scientific and
    Industrial Research (BCSIR) under the initiative of BCSIR Ladies Club. It
    was registered as a primary school in <i>1980</i>. It was recognized as a
    high school in <i>1984</i> and the school has grown in fame and glory and
    today has a three-storey, a two-storey teaching building and an
    administrative building. After serving as the headmaster of the school from
    March <i>1, 1969</i>, on the eve of its promotion to junior high school in
    <i>1983</i>, Priyadarshini <b>Mrs. Jebunnesa Begum</b> voluntarily left the
    post of headmaster and served as assistant headmaster until her retirement.
    <b>Mr. Kazi Nurul Haque</b> joined as headmaster in <i>1983</i>. In
    <i>1986, 11</i> students participated in the <i>1st</i> SSC examination and
    all of them passed with distinction. At present, science, humanities,
    business education branches are operational and there is a rich science
    laboratory and computer lab and a separate library. From
    <i>1986 to 1993</i>, under the able leadership of Headmaster
    <b>Md. Abdul Bari</b>, the school achieved a good reputation through 100%
    pass rate in primary scholarship, junior scholarship and SSC examination.
    Under the leadership of the very capable headmaster
    <b>Mr. Rabiul Islam</b> from <i>1993 to 1996</i>, the school became glorious
    with various achievements in board examinations and sports. But soon,
    <b>Mr. Rabiul Islam</b> left with tears in his eyes, making the well-wishers
    cry, and <b>Mr. Abu Taher</b> replaced him. Due to administrative weakness,
    indifference of the managing committee, various irregularities, outside
    interference in admission and promotion, nepotism and above all
    administrative conflicts, the school lost its tradition. The political
    situation of <i>01/11</i> also changed the situation of the school. From
    <i>2007 to 2009</i>, the school was revived under the supervision of the
    efficient and ever-observant managing committee, under the responsibility of
    the acting headmaster <b>Mrs. Fatema Khatun Chowdhury</b>. As a result,
    <i>36</i> students got A+ in the SSC examination in <i>2008</i> and
    <i>26</i> students got A+ in the SSC examination in <i>2009</i>, with a pass
    percentage of <i>99.28</i>. In such a bright time, the current headmaster
    <b>Mr. Md. Idris Ali</b> joined the school as the headmaster on
    <i>01/02/2009</i>. Under his youthful leadership, the school's
    infrastructure has improved dramatically and the school has been included in
    the "A" category school with various co-curricular activities, National Day
    celebrations, primary scholarship, junior scholarship and
    <i>99.28%</i> success in SSC exams. In addition, he himself won the award
    from the BSB Foundation as the best teacher and in <i>2010</i> the school
    won the award from the same organization as the best educational
    institution. The school participated in the Girl Guide London camp and is
    currently serving as the headmaster of Bangladesh Scouts' Dhaka Metropolitan
    Commissioner. The school has 3 branches in each class in double shift.
